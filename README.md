# A program to simulate the development of a Blockchain

# Introduction

  Blockchain is a sequence of records built to be highly resistant to change.Since 2018, blockchains have been used in many other contexts, e.g., other cryptocurrencies, crowd-funding and digital rights management, and supply chain management, anywhere where immutable public records of transactions are necessary.

# Program Description

This program simulates the development of a blockchain using sequential structure and cryptographic hash function. Program's functionalities include: 
   * Allow users to mine a new block and report accountsâ€™ balances
   * Record the transactions between two parties such as transferring money and receiving money 
 
The two parties are Alice and Bob. Initially, Alice starts with a non-negative amount of cash and no new cash is injected into the system. Each transaction is represented by a single integer that represents a transfer of money between Alice and Bob.
   * A negative transaction amount corresponds to transferring money from Alice to Bob.
   * A positive transaction amount corresponds to transferring money from Bob to Alice.
